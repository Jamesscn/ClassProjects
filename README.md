# Class Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects made for my university classes, and may require the use of external hardware. Every folder corresponds to a different project with constituent README files.

If you would like to run any of the web servers that come with the projects, **npm install** must be run in the server directory first because I deleted the beefy node_modules folders.
